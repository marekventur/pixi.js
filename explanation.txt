Adds ```PIXI.InfiniteShape``` and ```Graphics.drawEverything()```.

```PIXI.InfiniteShape``` is basically the oposite to ```PIXI.Rectangle.EMPTY```. Used as a hitArea it will always catch, used as a shape for Canvas it will fill the whole canvas.

We have quite a few cases in our codebase where we want to "dim" the whole screen and catch all clicks (modal dialogs, etc):

```
class ModalOverlay extends PIXI.Graphics {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.hitArea = new PIXI.Rect(-100000, -100000, 200000, 200000); // This is quite hacky
        this.fillColor = 0x000000;
        this.fillAlpha = 0.8;
        this.drawShape(this.hitArea);
    }
}
```

With this PR we can do this instead:

```
class ModalOverlay extends PIXI.Graphics {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.hitArea = new PIXI.InfiniteShape();
        this.fillColor = 0x000000;
        this.fillAlpha = 0.8;
        this.drawEverything(); // Alternatively: this.drawShape(this.hitArea);
    }
}
```

Disclaimer: I'm unsure about those two names. Suggestions are welcome.
